# RockLib.Metrics

If this application was instrumented with RockLib.Metrics at creation you'll see references to it in Startup.cs.
If not, metrics can be added after the fact with relative ease.

More information on Metrics and how to visualize them in Grafana is available in [Confluence](http://shorty/getmetrics).
